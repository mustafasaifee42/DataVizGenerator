# About DashboardBot

[DashboardBot](https://www.dashboardbot.mustafasaifee.com/) is an algorithm-driven design tool applied to data visualization. It generates variations of designs for different graphs.

## Inspiration

DashboardBot is inspired by [Uibot](https://www.uibot.app/) by [Janne Aukia](https://twitter.com/jaukia). The inspiration of styles comes from various examples on Dribbble.

## Implementation

DashboardBot is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) (for graphs). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app'). Favicon is [Bot](https://icons8.com/icon/q7wteb2_yVxu/bot) icon by [Icon8](https://icons8.com).
